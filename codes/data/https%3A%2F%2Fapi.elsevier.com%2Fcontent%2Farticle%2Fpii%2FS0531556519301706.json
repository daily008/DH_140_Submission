At 26\u202fmonths of age, exercise capacity was re-evaluated and extensor digitorum longus, gastrocnemius (GTN), and tibialis anterior (TA) muscles were excised for histological and biochemical analysis.\n               \n                  Results\n                  Both SED-HRT and SED-LRT rats showed decreased exercise capacity from 22 to 26\u202fmonths, but with 4\u202fmonths of treadmill training, EXER-HRT rats displayed a 50% improvement in exercise capacity while EXER-LRT rats maintained pre-training levels. Protein levels of antioxidant enzymes PRDX3, CuZnSOD, and PRXV were 6-fold greater in TA muscles of aged HRT rats compared to LRT rats. PGC-1\u03b1 protein levels were ~2-fold greater in GTN and TA muscles of aged HRT than in LRT rats and TFAM protein was similarly elevated in GTN muscles of aged HRT rats compared with LRT rats. BNIP3 protein levels were 5-fold greater in TA muscles of aged HRT than in LRT rats while PINK1 protein content was reduced by 78% in GTN muscles of aged HRT rats compared with LRT rats.\n               \n                  Conclusion\n                  HRT rats retained the ability to improve exercise capacity into late life and that ability was associated with inherent and adaptive changes in antioxidant enzyme levels and markers of and mitochondrial quality related to healthspan benefits in aging. Moreover, low intensity exercise prevented the age-associated decline in functional exercise capacity in LRT rats.\n               ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Aging"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Antioxidant enzymes"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Mitochondrial biogenesis"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Nonresponders"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Skeletal muscle"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0531556519301706", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0531556519301706", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "85069630562", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-85069630562", "pubmed-id": "31306740", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85069630562", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20190712", "$": "2019-07-12"}}}}}
